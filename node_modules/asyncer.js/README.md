## :clipboard: Example



```js
const asyncer = require("asyncer.js");

let log = console.log;

let tasks = [
    // Execute this sync function
    () => { log("First"); }

    // *Then* execute an async one
  , cb => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            log("Waited a second");
            cb();
        }, 1000);
    }

    // Another async function
  , cb => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            log("Waited another second");
            cb();
        }, 1000);
    }

    // *Then* Execute the following group
  , [
        // ...containing a sync function
        () => { log("First in nested group"); }
      , {
            // ...and a group of parallel functions
            // to run in the same time
            parallel: [
                cb => {
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        log("In parallel 1");
                        cb();
                    }, 1000);
                }
              , cb => {
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        log("Second one in parallel, but I'll be faster.");
                        cb();
                    }, 100);
                }
            ]
        }

        // After that group of parallel function, execute
        // this group of parallel functions

                        cb();

                    setTimeout(() => {
                        log("Waited 100ms ");
                        cb();

    // An another async one

    // =>
    // First
    // Waited a second
    // Waited another second

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`

Thanks! :heart:


## :dizzy: Where is this library used?
If you are using this library in one of your projects, add it in this list. :sparkles:


 - [`transformer`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/transformer#readme)—Transform data using synchronous and asynchronous functions.
